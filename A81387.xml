            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172256:16"/>Angels; the <hi>Mouth</hi> that's full of rotten, corrupt communication, evil ſpeaking, reviling, or that thirſts after the blood of our neighbour, to drink the Blood of Chriſt; <hi>Eyes</hi> gazing on vanity, to look on <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Oh, how pure ought I to keep thoſe <hi>doors</hi> of my <hi>Soul,</hi> at which the King of Glory ſo often enters? Shall I kiſs his hand with filthy lips? put hallowed bread and wine into a noyſom ſink? go to that Table as Swine to their trough, in my pollution? raviſh, contemn the grace and mercy of God? tear them aſunder from the conditions he hath annexed to them? He will not be <hi>one</hi> with an Harlot; nor ſeen with the ſame eyes. His Body never ſaw <hi>Corruption,</hi> nor will be mixed with <hi>it:</hi> It lay in a <hi>Virgin</hi> Womb and Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, and ſtill reſides only in <hi>Virgin</hi> Souls, Devoted, Conſecrated, ſet apart to his uſe and ſervice. His glorified body is no more capable of diſhonour, nor will enter into an earthly ſoul. Unclean birds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the <hi>Carcaſs</hi> of the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> without the <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>Wine</hi> without the <hi>Blood;</hi> both without the <hi>bleſſing;</hi> the <hi>Elements,</hi> but not the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> ſuch are guilty of his Body and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172256:16"/>Blood, for reaching out their hand with purpoſe to receive him into a polluted ſoul, though he withdraw himſelf that they cannot partake of him: They <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi> their <hi>Prince,</hi> by ſhewing <hi>it</hi> to his <hi>Statue</hi> erected for his honour and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; are guilty of <hi>Treaſon</hi> by offering Indignity to his Seal and Picture; <hi>diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> done to the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>repreſentation,</hi> reflects upon the <hi>Original;</hi> he is <hi>perſonally</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and will be no where <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally</hi> but in the <hi>Heavenly</hi> part of man; he finds no <hi>reſt</hi> in a <hi>heart</hi> full of vain, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thoughts; it ſtinks like the lake of <hi>Sodom;</hi> he retires thence vexed with the unclean Converſation of the impure Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. When he approaches to a ſoul, and finds it a Cage of unclean Birds, he flyes with the wings of a Dove to clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and whiter Habitations. But if we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, hate, and have no fondneſs of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for them; and with complacency en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the contrary, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed our feet, and then he invites us to his <hi>Supper.</hi> The <hi>unavoidable infirmities</hi> of our lives, againſt which we daily ſtrive, and for which we never have any kindneſs or affection, are not ſpots in theſe feaſts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:172256:17"/>of Charitie, but inſtruments of Humility, and ſtronger invitations to come to Rites ordain'd for corroboratives gainſt infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and for growth in the inner man. But remanent affection to a ſin, enmitie with neighbours, ſecular avocations to the height of care and trouble, excuſe not, but increaſe mens ſin, and ſecure their miſery 'Tis juſt they graze with <hi>Goats,</hi> that refuſe to waſh their hands that they may come to the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lamb. The excuſes wherewith they palliate their neglects of waiting upon our Lord, and accepting his kindneſs, all grow upon this bitter root of an <hi>unholy careleſs life, loving the world and the luſts thereof:</hi> the only reaſon is, they have a mind to live as ſtrangers to him, and not to be his <hi>houſhold ſervants</hi> and <hi>domeſticks,</hi> for then they might always come unto him. They think they muſt not come <hi>ſo oft,</hi> becauſe to prepare themſelves coſts them <hi>ſo much time;</hi> but would they ſpare <hi>ſo much,</hi> as to lead a <hi>holy life,</hi> and be at <hi>ſo much</hi> trouble as to <hi>pleaſe God</hi> in <hi>other things,</hi> they would not find it ſo laborious to pleaſe him in <hi>this.</hi> Kept they always a fear of God in their Souls, they would without much pains be fit to approach
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:172256:17"/>with fear and reverence into his preſence; would they fear to do what God hath <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi> they would not fear to do what he hath <hi>commanded:</hi> but while they refuſe to obey him in one thing, no wonder they do in another. <hi>Religion</hi> concerns not our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> only, but the <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>minds;</hi> and the ſame <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual graces</hi> are to be <hi>daily exercis'd,</hi> though in a lower meaſure and degree. <hi>Every day</hi> is to be <hi>holy</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> though <hi>every action</hi> in the day be not equally <hi>holy.</hi> When we labour conſcienciouſly to ſtand to our firſt Promiſe and Covenant, all the actions of our lives become <hi>holy;</hi> and ſo we are <hi>holy</hi> in our <hi>Shop,</hi> by diligence and juſtice; at our <hi>Board,</hi> by temperance, thankfulneſs, charity; <hi>Abroad,</hi> by an innocent, uſeful converſation; in our <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi> by Prayer, and Meditation; yea, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the ends of health and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs will make our <hi>ſleeps</hi> and <hi>recreations holy,</hi> and not to be reckon'd among <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi> but the neceſſary ſeaſons of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little or nothing, that afterwards we may be worthily imployed. A <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> behaves himſelf not for ſuch a ſet number of days, as if <hi>ſo much
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:172256:18"/>time</hi> were to be ſpent in <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and ſo much in <hi>ſin;</hi> but as if he accounted his whole life an opportunity of ſerving God, and of cleanſing himſelf from all that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, which will not let him ſee his face. He receives daily what daily profits, and ſo lives that he may daily receive it. <hi>A Holy Life</hi> is a perpetual Sacrifice, and he that ſo lives, keeps his heart as an <hi>Holy Altar,</hi> alwayes warm and glowing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him; he offers up daily ſuch Sacrifices as are acceptable to God, and prepare him for a due commemoration of this great Sacrifice; a conſtant abſtinence from all forbidden things, and care to perform ſuch duties as maintain a lively ſenſe of God in our Souls, would make us vehemently hunger after this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Food. A <hi>circumſpect life</hi> makes us both <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>deſirous</hi> to converſe with God eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; <hi>good Actions</hi> beget in us greater longings after grace, and <hi>good deſires</hi> make us ſtill do well, out of hope to have more grace; when a good man lifts up his heart to God, he draws down God into his Soul, that he may work with his hands that which is good in his <hi>employment,</hi> in which he is not ſo buſie that his <hi>hands</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:172256:18"/>ſhould grow ſo heavy, or dirty by it, as to be unwilling or unfit to lift <hi>them</hi> up again to God. Such a <hi>Combination</hi> is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all that God requires to make them eaſie and familiar, pleaſant and deſirable, and our obedience impartial and univerſal. A <hi>holy behaviour</hi> in our calling, converſes, and uſe of the creature, diſpoſes us to <hi>Acts of immediate worſhip,</hi> that requites and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the kindneſs by diſpoſing and fitting us for a <hi>holy deportment</hi> for the future, which is it ſelf an invitation of God to our ſouls; much more when ſeconded with the Attractives of <hi>Holy Prayers</hi> and <hi>affectionate deſires.</hi> The ſweetneſs of ſuch converſes with God, and the power of his Grace conſequent upon our hearty deſires, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages and enables us to a holy converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which brings us (from familiarity with the Devil) to fellowſhip with God, the happineſs of which is ſo great, that it excites us to do all we can to maintain and prevent our being tempted from it. <hi>Good Hearts</hi> daily mortified, and ſtrictly watched over, like dry wood, with one blaſt kindle the flame of love, ſtir up the Grace of God in them; while thoſe ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world, like green ſticks, all their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:172256:19"/>puffing, blowing, and prayers will ſcarce fetch any fire. Oh! would I every day prepare for the day of death; or (which is of a like conſideration) the day of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, (nothing leſs will ſit me to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate then to depart hence;) ſet my ſelf in order, meditate often everie day on Chriſts firſt and ſecond coming; not ſtay a minute, but inſtantly grieve for, ſeverely condemn my ſelf, and renew my reſolution to amend all, and pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtrength againſt whatſoever I have obſerved amiſs: would I conſider where I fall ofteneſt, from what principle this default comes, what are the beſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and paſs on to a real and vigorous uſe of them. Did I reſolve to have God frequently in my thoughts, to bring it to paſs to have ſo great a dread and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of him, that I may be more reallie aſhamed, troubled, confounded, to ſin in his preſence and obſervation, then of the ſevereſt man's; and to have a perpetual intercourſe and converſe with him: Or would I actually attend to what I do, and conſider everie action, and ſpeak ſo little that I might conſider it; I ſhould find, that upon the day of <hi>Communion</hi> I ſhould have

Oh that the fire of love would now kindle and burn in my Soul; boil up, even run over with love unto thee! Oh that I had the flames of a <hi>Seraphim,</hi> the voice of an <hi>Angel</hi> to ſing thy praiſe! Oh that I could go out of my ſelf when I remember thee, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of thee without an Extaſie! for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, and quit all the world to live upon thee! The thoughts of what thou haſt done is able to break an heart of Marble with love, to turn a Rock into a Fountain of tears, to unlooſe the tongue of the dumb, that they may ſound forth thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs.</p>
               <p>Oh, after all his foregoing ſufferings feeſt thou him not (my Soul) faſtened to the Croſs, conflicting with his Fathers wrath, groaning under the weight and burthen of our Sins? Look how his whole Body is ſtretched and tentered, his Hands and Feet bored through, his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood trickles down; and how miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the Thorns pierce his holy Head.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:172256:72"/>See how his Looks are changed, his Cheeks pale, his Bloud going, his Neck too weak to ſupport his Head, which lies a dying on his bleeding Breaſt.

Hear you not his dying groans, the taunts of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yea the groans of the Earth, under the weight of his Croſs? See the Sun bluſhing under a veil of darkneſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Son of Righteouſneſs under an Eclipſe?

He harboured no grief of his own, but is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the juſt and deadly griefs of others: he takes our ſorrows on him to beſtow upon us his joy: he ſorrows for us, that hath neither cauſe nor likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to ſorrow for himſelf.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:172256:72"/>What but his all-ſufficient patience could endure? What but mans heinous ſins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, ſuch his ſad and wrathfull dolors? Ah ſinful wretches! 'tis our doings, that he ſuffers; our evil, but his ſmart; our treſpaſs, his puniſhment. His breaſt is made a large receptable for our cares; his back a common prop unto our load; he was delivered for our offences; he was ſlain, but not for himſelf, he bore our grief; and carried our ſorrows; he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our trangreſſions; bruiſed for our iniquities; for the tranſgreſſions of his people was he ſmitten.

Behold, Oh Lord, the bleeding wounds of thy own Son; remember how his body was broken; think upon his precious blood ſhed for us; let us dye, if he hath not made a full ſatisfaction; we deſire not to be pardoned if he hath not paid our
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:172256:82"/>debt. But canſt thou behold him, and not be well-pleaſed with us? canſt thou look upon his body and blood which we preſent to thee, and turn thy face from us? Oh let us prevail in the vertue of his Sacrifice for the Graces and Bleſſings we need!

While we are remembring him at his Table, he is remembring us at his Father's right hand.</p>
               <p>I am not only guilty, but polluted; ſin hath as well defiled, as it would damn me. But oh remember who loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own <hi>blood;</hi> of virtue and Spirit to purifie me, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and merit to pacifie thee. To this <hi>Fountain which thou haſt ſet open</hi> I bring my polluted Soul; and what hinders but that I may waſh and be clean? be purged from the filth, as well as pardon'd for, and ſaved from the guilt of all my ſins? for the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſins.</p>
               <p>Oh how often is my Soul caſt down
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:172256:83"/>within me? my omiſſions and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, my ſins and duties (as I perform them) diſcomfort me; I am aſhamed of, and bluſh to ſee them; my petitions for pardon ſtand in need of pardon; my tears of waſhing, my beſt performances are provocations, and help to fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of my ſins; but for the Prieſt that offers, the Altar that ſanctifies all my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, the ſweet incenſe he offers with our prayers.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Prieſthood</hi> is for ever available, and effectual for us. Here is wine ſweetned with the love of God, perfumed with the divine nature; that <hi>chears</hi> the heart of God by way of ſatisfaction, and the heart of Man by way of pacification; that makes peace in Heaven and within us, and all our Sacrifices wellpleaſing unto <hi>thee;</hi> who dealſt not with <hi>us</hi> according to <hi>our frailties,</hi> but <hi>ſtate</hi> in <hi>our Advocate;</hi> who when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſate down on the Right hand of the Majeſty on high, and ever lives to make interceſſion for us. If thy grace prevented us before Repentance that we might return, ſhall it not much more prevent Repenting ſinners that we may not periſh? how canſt thou but
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:172256:83"/>love them that love thee, ſeeing thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us when we hated thee?</p>
               <p>Oh my ſtony, unrelenting heart! how unaffected am I with my own vileneſs, and thy goodneſs, the evil of ſin, and excellency of grace, the worth of my Soul, and death of my Saviour! but the blood of Chriſt is able to ſoften and mollifie the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate ſinner. Oh that I could feel the vertue and power of it diſſolving this rock into a fountain of tears, a relenting frame, a heart of fleſh.</p>
               <p>My luſts and Corruptions are many and mighty; too <hi>ſtrong</hi> for me, but not for thy ſelf. As in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, man died legally, ſo in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>'s death, ſin died virtually. He ſuffered to ſave his people from their ſins, that <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> and not <hi>ſin</hi> ſhould have dominion over us. Shall not that blood mortifie my pride, worldlineſs, inordinate affections, which ſhall ſubdue the whole body of ſin? ſhall I reproach or make void his death unto my own Soul? or by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſin, that brought ſo great a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on ſo great a perſon, be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enemy to him then the <hi>Jews</hi> were? How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:172256:84"/>any longer therein, knowing this, that our Old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin. Oh that I may henceforth find and reckon my ſelf to be dead unto ſin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord!</p>
               <p>Oh how am I tempted, and aſſaulted! that I am ſometimes ready to ſay, I ſhall one day fall by my ſpiritual enemies; but Faith gives us a ſhare in the <hi>victories</hi> of Chriſt: having ſpoyled all Principalities and Powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them as our enemies: in, on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Chariot, took away from them all poſſibility to hurt: though they aſſault us ſtill, we are aſſured of an abſolute vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. The accuſer of the Brethren is caſt down, which accuſed them before God day and night, and they overcome by the <hi>Blood of the Lamb,</hi> that hath quenched the flames of divine fury, and all our enemies are reconciled, or ſubdued.</p>
               <p>Ah my Lord! how often doth ſin and the world deadden my heart, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards thee? O how dull, how indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed? that I cannot pray with life, nor
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:172256:84"/>be lively in thy ſervice: but this blood was ſhed to ſet Priſoners free; and is the life of all our duties, graces, and comforts. Oh that its power and efficacy may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and enliven me, may put vivacity, and activity in me! that I may pray, and hear, receive, meditate, and diſcourſe of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things with freedom and liberty, liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and chearfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Oh that I may no more, as I have too too often, disbelieve, or queſtion the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> of this life, or that to come. For this Blood ratifies and confirms the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace; not only <hi>purchaſed,</hi> but <hi>aſſures</hi> us of all good things. Chriſt's Will and Teſtament, wherein he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed ſuch precious legacies to his people, is now of force; for a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> is of force after the Teſtator is dead.</p>
               <p>Oh how ought it to affect me, for the betraying of innocent Blood! he was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, in his hands no wickedneſs, in his heart no ſin, no guile found in his mouth. I and my brethren are guilty, but for this ſpotleſs Lamb, what hath he done? and where there is no <hi>ſin,</hi> thou inflicteſt no <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> But he was numbred with the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:172256:85"/>Tranſgreſſors; ſurely then the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all: for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; by his knowledge ſhall my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities. Oh! I take thee at thy word, and do believe all my <hi>ſins,</hi> with all thine Elects were imputed to <hi>our ſurety;</hi> and the wages of ſin inflicted on him, that we might be fully acquitted and diſcharged.</p>
               <p>I am guilty of many aggravated ſins, and am the greateſt of ſinners; but with thee is plenteous redemption through Chriſt Jeſus who ſhed his Blood, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were <hi>Righteous,</hi> but to make us <hi>So:</hi> of infinite, <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>merit;</hi> as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for me, as if none elſe were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or ſaved by it. He is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come unto thee by him.</p>
               <p>Oh how ſmall, how imperfect are my Graces? how cold my Love? how weak my Faith? How faint my deſires after thee? but the leaſt degree of Grace is the fruit of this Blood: Oh that I may find <hi>it's</hi> efficacy, perfecting that good work thou haſt begun in me, from ſtrengh to

And he hath on his <hi>veſture,</hi> (the title is conſpicuous) and on his thigh, (the place of ſtrength) <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Wherefore art thou red in thy apparel, and thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like him that treadeth the wine fat?

Oh, I beheld his blood ſtreaming down
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:172256:93"/>through the holes in his ſide! Oh what? fight, a fire, a flame of love did I ſee in his bleſſed <hi>Heart,</hi> and my ſelf pourtray'd upon it? my name among the reſt, oh with what joy and comfort to my Soul! he hath ſet me as a Seal upon his Heart; love is ſtrong as death, many waters of affliction cannot quench it, nor the floods of trouble or perſecution drown it; might all the pleaſures, profits, honours of the world be given for it, it would be utterly deſpiſed. Oh how eaſie find I his yoke! how light his burthen! methinks I could watch or pray, do or ſuffer more believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, more couragiouſly than ever. It was the voice of my Beloved that knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, open unto me my Siſter, my Love, my Dove, my Undefiled: he put in his hands by the holes of the door, and my bowels were moved for him; my Soul failed when he ſpake, I ſought him in every part of the Ordinance, and he was found of me; I called him, and he gave me anſwer: I ſate under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte. He brought me to the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting houſe, and his Banner over me was Love. His left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me. A
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:172256:93"/>bundle of Myrrh is my Beloved unto me, he ſhall lye all night betwixt my Breaſts; he ſhall be ſtill in my heart by affection and Faith? I will make him my continual joy, comfort, and refreſhment; and ſolace my ſelf in him in all eſtates. Oh that his <hi>name</hi> may be graven upon my heart! and his <hi>Image</hi> remain fair and lively upon my Soul! Oh that I may find a kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to admit of any other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: when I come to converſe with other things, let me ſtill be looking towards him as my only deſire, good, and happineſs, let my heart be ſo filled with him, that other objects may not come near, or make any ſtrong impreſſion on me. Oh that ſome lively coles of that holy fire kindled at the Ordinances, may be ſtill glowing in my Soul; that the ſavour and tincture of it may be never done away. Oh how can any other <hi>pleaſure</hi> ſeem any more pleaſant to me? Can I deſire the husks the Swine do eat, when there is ſuch Bread in my Fathers houſe? no man having drunk old wine, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way deſireth new, for he ſaith, the old is better. Sure he hath been little affected, nor had any taſte of Gods ſweetneſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:172256:94"/>to reliſh worldly things; to waſh off his palate the ſavour of ſpiritual with ſenſual or ſecular thoughts. Abrupt chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings off from Holy Duties is ſuch a quenching of the ſpirit, as tends much to hardning the heart: ſuch ſudden quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſpiritual heat got in an Ordinance, cannot be without much danger to the Soul; motions ſo quite oppoſite, are as prejudicial, as unbecoming. Is it fit or ſeemly to leave the company of our Lord ſo ſoon as we have let him in, and divert to other occaſions? aſſociate our ſelves to other perſons, now we have newly given him our Faith, and taken him as the Bridegroom of our Souls? and not rather delight in the preſence of our new love; and keep our heart from cooling by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on new fuel; turning the remainder of this day into an <hi>after ſupper,</hi> a <hi>ſecond Communion.</hi> In reviewing and being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for our coldneſs, diſtractions, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages.

               <p>AND now my utmoſt care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is required to expreſs the power and efficacy of the Ordinance, in living more fruitfully, religiouſly, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; in making good my vows and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes at the Sacrament.

               <p>
                  <hi>Make a ſolemn reflection on thy ſelf and entertainment.</hi>] How was my heart and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:172256:95"/>behaviour before God, what welcom did he give me? <hi>Reflection</hi> is neceſſary after <hi>every duty:</hi> what good have I got? what warmth of affection? what more love to, deſire after, delight and confidence in God? what greater ability and love to diſcharge duty, to bear affliction, to reſiſt temptation, to walk in Gods ways? ſo eſpecially <hi>after the Sacrament,</hi> was my Heart hard, dull, indiſpoſed? I muſt then ſuſpect my miſcarriage in preparation or performance; and labour to find out, be truely ſenſible of, greatly bewaile, and humble, judge, and condemn my ſelf, and beg pardon for the cauſe; earneſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune him that he would now help me by Prayer and Humiliation, to recover the benefit of the Ordinance, that I may by an <hi>after act</hi> do that which I ſhould have done before. Sorrow for, and ſenſe of our ſenſleſneſs, is one fruit of Chriſts death we undoubtedly receiv'd in the Ordinance. We may not judge of our gain by, and profit in <hi>duty</hi> by our <hi>preſent feeling:</hi> or that the only evidences of <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>acceptance with God,</hi> are, <hi>our Souls lifted up and raviſhed with ſenſible joys:</hi> our uprightneſs and ſincerity in the perform<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:172256:96"/>
                  <hi>of</hi> our duties, and <hi>in</hi> our <hi>covenanting</hi> with God, and continuing ſtedfaſt therein, may adminiſter moſt ground of comfort when we reflect upon it: for we were then really acceptable to <hi>him</hi> that look'd down upon us, and received from him a ſeal to the promiſe of pardon and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, though he did not teſtifie it by giving in extraordinary joys. He looks not ſo much at fits of paſſion, as at the ſteady bent and tenour of the Soul. The trueſt <hi>Communion</hi> with God, is to enjoy the <hi>Communication of his Graces,</hi> whereby we are made conformable to him; we may enjoy the ſaving influences of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> when we cannot feel his more abundant conſolations. Though <hi>this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi> be not at preſent joyous, yet may afterwards yield the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs to thoſe that are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant therein. It cannot be well known what <hi>Grace</hi> we have received (further meaſures of which are the holy Spirits accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe means, being the great benefit we are apt to expect) till we come to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of <hi>it</hi> in duty and againſt temptation. But oh, how much cauſe have I to rejoyce in his love and goodneſs, to render him
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:172256:96"/>hearty thanks (who might have left me as well as others to my ſelf) for his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and refreſhment, for his ſatisfying me ſo abundantly with the fatneſs of his houſe, and making me drink of the river of his pleaſure; eſpecially now I find (and oh that I could more and more) ſuch <hi>real benefit</hi> received by it; my ſoul more deeply broken and humbled under the ſenſe of <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> become more loathſom, hateful, burdenſom to me. My heart truely thankful for what I have enjoyed, and ſorrowful I have enjoyed no more; more ſtrongly engaged and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to inward and univerſal <hi>holineſs:</hi> my Faith in Chriſt more encreaſed and ſetled; my love to him more inflamed; my Soul ſtrengthned and emboldned to undergo any thing for him: my ſpiritual delight and joy in him raiſed, and leſſened to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: my eſteem and valuation of the Ordinance heightned, my Graces in it exerciſed; my deſires after full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God and Chriſt in Glory more enlarged. If he were pleaſed to kill me, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a Meat-offering at my hands; neither would he have ſhewed me all theſe things;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:172256:97"/>nor as at this time, have given me to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſuch things as theſe. Oh that I may always retain a thankful ſenſe of all his benefits! Oh how much am I beholden to thee my God? I have been praiſing of thee, but nothing to what I ought, or what thou deſerv'ſt. Oh, how can I ceaſe to magnifie thee? for what I am and have, for the uſe of thy creatures, and thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with them; for every crum, much more for Chriſt, that foundation mercy, that hath all mercies folded up in him, and entail'd unto him; that ſweetens and ſanctifies every mercy: for this Feaſt on his Body and Blood, for the joys of thy houſe, and the viands of heaven; for any meaſure of life and affection, raiſedneſs and comfort, grace and goodneſs. Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me bleſs his holy name. While I live I will praiſe thee, I will ſing praiſe unto my God, while I have a being: and what is here wanting in thy due praiſe, I will pay hereafter in everlaſting Hallelujahs.</p>
